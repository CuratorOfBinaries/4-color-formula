The idea behind the tool is that you can create color combos using a HSL formula. You can create a color combinations by simply adjusting the hue.

# What is HSL?

HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. It is a color model that is commonly used in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to select colors for CSS selectors.

In the HSL color model, the hue represents the type of color (e.g., red, blue, green), the saturation represents the intensity or purity of the color, and the lightness represents the brightness or darkness of the color.

To use HSL to select a color for a CSS selector, you can specify the values for hue, saturation, and lightness using the hsl() function in CSS. Here's an example:

In this example, the hsl() function is used to set the color of the .selector CSS selector. The first value inside the parentheses, 120, represents the hue (in degrees), which corresponds to the color green. The second value, 100%, represents the saturation, which means the color is fully saturated. The third value, 50%, represents the lightness, which means the color is neither too bright nor too dark.

By using the HSL color model, you have more flexibility in selecting colors and can easily adjust the hue, saturation, and lightness values to achieve the desired color effect.
